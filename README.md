# Onion Architecture in AspNetCoreBackendBase

Onion Architecture is a software design pattern that promotes a clean **_Separation of Concerns_**, enhancing scalability and maintainability. By structuring applications from the core outward, this pattern facilitates easier testing and modification. It ensures **_Loose Coupling_** between different layers of the system, which enhances flexibility and reduces dependencies among components.

Layers of Onion Architecture are **Domain Layer**, **Application Layer**, **Infrastructure Layer**, **Persistence Layer** and **Presentation Layer**.

## Domain Layer

For details on the Domain Layer, refer to [Domain Layer](README-DomainLayer.md).

## Application Layer

For details on the Application Layer, refer to [Application Layer](README-ApplicationLayer.md).

## Infrastructure Layer

For details on the Infrastructure Layer, refer to [Infrastructure Layer](README-InfrastructureLayer.md).

## Persistence Layer

For details on the Persistence Layer, refer to [Persistence Layer](README-PersistenceLayer.md).

## Presentation Layer

For details on the Presentation Layer, refer to [Presentation Layer](README-PresentationLayer.md).

## Key Principles

Understanding key architectural principles helps ensure that the application remains maintainable, flexible, and scalable. The following principles are fundamental to achieving a well-structured and efficient application design:

### Loose Coupling

**_Loose Coupling_** refers to designing components so that changes in one component have minimal impact on others. By reducing dependencies between components, the system becomes more modular and easier to maintain. **_Loose Coupling_** enhances flexibility and allows for easier replacement or modification of components without affecting the entire system.

### Separation of Concerns

**_Separation of Concerns_** is about dividing a system into distinct sections, each responsible for a specific aspect of functionality. This principle ensures that different parts of the application handle different concerns, such as data access, business logic, and presentation. By keeping these concerns separate, the system is more organized, and changes to one aspect are less likely to affect others.

### Inversion of Control (IoC)

**_Inversion of Control_** (IoC) is a design principle where the control flow of the application is inverted from the traditional model. Instead of components managing their dependencies, the control is transferred to an external framework or container. This allows for more flexible component management and reduces the coupling between components.

### Dependency Injection (DI)

**_Dependency Injection_** (DI) is a technique used to achieve **_Inversion of Control_** by injecting dependencies into a class rather than the class creating them internally. This promotes loose coupling and enhances testability by allowing different implementations of dependencies to be injected as needed. **_Dependency Injection_** (DI) simplifies the management of dependencies and supports the separation of concerns.

### Fluent API

**_Fluent API_** is a programming style that allows for method chaining to configure or build objects in a more readable and expressive manner. It provides a fluent interface that can be used to create or configure objects by chaining method calls together, making the code easier to read and write.
